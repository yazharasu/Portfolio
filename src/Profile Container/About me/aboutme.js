                        <p>I'm Yazharasu, a creative problem-solver with a diverse background in product design, teaching, and front-end web development. 
                            With 2 years of experience in product design and development and 5 years in teaching, I've honed my ability to think critically, communicate effectively, and collaborate with others to bring ideas to life. 
                            And in the past year, I've been leveraging my skills in HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React to build dynamic and user-friendly web applications.
                        </p>

                        <p>But my journey to front-end engineering wasn't a straight line. In fact, I first dipped my toes in front-end technologies while teaching for a year, and I fell in love with the creativity and problem-solving involved in building web applications. 
                            I am currently working as a senior software engineer at Iamneo.ai Edutech Pvt Ltd.
                        </p>

                        <p>Whether I'm working on a new project or collaborating with a team, I bring a positive attitude, a thirst for learning, and a commitment to delivering high-quality work. I'm also familiar with tools like Angular, Next.js, node.js, and mongoDB.
                        </p>
